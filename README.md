🌌🎮 Galactic Arcade Landing Page
A Retro Arcade × Cosmic Universe UI Experience
Welcome to Galactic Arcade, a uniquely designed landing page built for the Contribution Sprint – Open Innovation Challenge.
This project fuses:
✨ Retro 8-bit arcade vibes
✨ Cosmic planetary visuals
✨ Orbit animations & starfields
✨ Neon gradients + pixel aesthetics
All wrapped inside a modern, responsive, Next.js + TailwindCSS layout.
🚀 Project Overview
Galactic Arcade is a complete visual redesign experiment where I transformed a basic landing page into an immersive sci-fi pixel-art universe.
The theme is a blend of:
Retro arcade UI elements (pixel borders, 8-bit fonts, CRT glow)
Planetary and orbit animations (rotating icons, cosmic gradients)
Starfield backgrounds with parallax motion
Smooth Framer Motion interactions
Neon futuristic color palette
The result is a landing page that feels like a sci-fi game intro screen—alive, animated, and unforgettable.
